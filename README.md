# ProgrammingandScriptingGMIT
## This repository contains Exercises for the 2018 GMIT Programming and Scripting Course

### To run the files:
1. Download and install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. I recommend using visual studio to run the files https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/

#### Respository content, descriptions of exercises and instructions how to run the associated scripts:

Note: separate file versions have also been added for some exercises the respository, these are versions where I made changes to the code after the exercise was due to be completed. 

Topic 1: Basics of programming and Topic 2: State, variables and Statements

Exercise 1: Contained in the file Exercise_1_and_2_v1.0.py. Change the program given in Topic 1 to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. 

Exercise 2: Also contained in the file Exercise_1_and_2_v1.0.py. Copy and run the program contained in https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python-fib/blob/master/fibname.py. I changed the string variable to my own name and re-ran it to give the following results:

My first name is Simon
The first letter S is number 83
The last letter n is number 110
Fibonacci number 193 is 9663391306290450775010025392525829059713

Instructions: In the visual studio terminal type Python Exercise_1_and_2_v1.0.py to run the program, alternatively you can copy the tasks.json file and click Ctrl Shift b to automatically run it. If you wish to use this on your own name change row 18 from "Simon" to "yourname". 

The explaination of the Python ord() Function as described on the https://www.jquery-az.com website: The ord() function is used to return an integer of the given single Unicode character. The returned integer represents the Unicode code point.

Topic 3: Conditions, loops and flow control

Exercise3: Contained in Exercise_3_v1.0.py. Write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. Exercise_3_v1.1.py has been enhanced to ask the user for an input instead of using a starting value of 17. 

Instructions: Open the file in visual studio and either type Python Exercise_3_v1.0.py then press return, unless using the short cut keys provided by the tasks.json file. 

Topic 4: Lists

Exercise 4: Contained in the file named Exercise_4_v1.0.py. Write a script to solve problem 5 from Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

Instructions: Open the file in visual studio and either type Python Exercise_4_v1.0.py.py then press return, unless using the short cut keys provided by the tasks.json file.

Exercise 5. Topic 5: Input and output

Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. On the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.

Exercise 6. Topic 6: Functions

Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial.
