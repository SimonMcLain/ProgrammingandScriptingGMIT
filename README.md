## This repository contains Exercises for the 2018 GMIT Programming and Scripting Course

### To run the files:
1. Download and install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. I recommend using visual studio to run the files https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/

#### Respository content, descriptions of exercises and instructions how to run the associated scripts:

Exercise 1 and Exercise 2. Topic 1: Basics of programming and Topic 2: State, variables and Statements

Exercise 1:  Change the program given in Topic 1 to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. 

Exercise 2: Copy and run the program contained in https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python-fib/blob/master/fibname.py. I changed the string variable to my own name and re-ran it. 

Explaination of the Python ord() Function as described on the https://www.jquery-az.com website: The ord() function is used to return an integer of the given single Unicode character. The returned integer represents the Unicode code point.

Exercise 3. Topic 3: Conditions, loops and flow control

Write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. Exercise_3_v1.1.py has been enhanced to ask the user for an input instead of using a starting value of 17. 

Exercise 4. Topic 4: Lists

Write a script to solve problem 5 from Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

Exercise 5. Topic 5: Input and output

Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. On the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.

Exercise 6. Topic 6: Functions

Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial.
